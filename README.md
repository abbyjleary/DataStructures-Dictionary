# Data Structures Dictionary Project

This project was written for my CS3610 Data Structures class in Fall of 2022. The purpose of this project was to recreate the C++ map class. 

The only files I modified were dictionary.cc and dictionary.h. Other files were provided by Nasseef Abukamail (professor at Ohio University).

Project can be compiled with `make` and run with `./a.out` (running the program only runs the tests created in `main()`). Other tests in _TEST folder can be run with `make run_tests`.
